            "answer": "Based on the search results, here is the key information about the tools IKEA uses in manufacturing their goods:\nIKEA provides all the tools required for assembly with each of their furniture products. Typically, this includes items like allen wrenches, nuts, bolts, and screws that are needed to assemble the furniture.\nThe assembly documents for each IKEA product specify exactly which tools are included with that particular item. If any additional tools are required, such as drills or hammers, this will also be noted in the assembly instructions.\nIKEA's focus on providing all the necessary assembly tools with their products is part of their strategy to make furniture accessible and easy for customers to assemble themselves. This \"do-it-yourself\" approach is a key aspect of IKEA's operational model that helps them keep costs low.\nIn terms of the manufacturing process itself, the search results do not provide detailed information about the specific tools and equipment used by IKEA in their production facilities. The emphasis seems to be more on the final assembly and packaging of the products for distribution.",
