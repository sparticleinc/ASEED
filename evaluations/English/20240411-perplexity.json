They set a target price point first, then design the product to meet that price while still maintaining quality and functionality.4 This involves using a limited selection of standardized raw materials and production processes to reduce waste and costs.4\nIKEA also utilizes efficient packaging and distribution methods to minimize costs. They package their furniture in flat, space-saving boxes that can be easily transported and stored.34 This \"flat packing\" approach reduces fuel and storage costs.3\nIn terms of inventory management, IKEA's stores serve as both retail showrooms and warehouses. Customers can retrieve the flat-packed products themselves, reducing handling costs.3 IKEA also has an advanced forecasting system to predict demand and balance production volumes accordingly.4\nIKEA works closely with its network of over 1,800 suppliers globally to innovate efficient, low-cost manufacturing processes. They foster long-term relationships with suppliers rather than just competing on price.4 IKEA also has a supplier code of conduct called IWAY to ensure sustainable and ethical practices.3\nOverall, IKEA's operational model is focused on design, packaging, distribution, inventory, and supplier management to drive efficiency and keep costs low across its entire value chain.4",

Agnostics are open to the possibility of God's existence, while atheists reject it.34\nAgnosticism can exist on a spectrum, with \"strong\" agnostics believing the existence of God is unknowable, and \"weak\" agnostics believing it is currently unknown but potentially knowable in the future.5\nAgnosticism has a long history, with the term first coined by biologist T.H. Huxley in 1869. It represents an attitude of open-mindedness and uncertainty about metaphysical questions.5\n\nIn summary, agnosticism is a philosophical position of uncertainty about the existence of God or ultimate reality, in contrast to the beliefs of theism and atheism.12345",

This is separate from the CEC-AC rating.\n\n\nThe CEC has implemented a solar mandate that requires new residential and many new commercial buildings in California to include solar panel installations, in order to promote renewable energy adoption5.\n\n\nIn summary, CEC refers to the California Energy Commission, the state agency that regulates and oversees solar power in California, including setting performance ratings, listing requirements, and mandates for solar installations.",

            "answer": "Based on the search results, a low melting point for a compound is generally not ideal for successful recrystallization. Here's a summary:\nThe key to successful recrystallization is having a compound that is more soluble in the hot solvent than in the cold solvent. Compounds with low melting points tend to be more soluble in solvents even at lower temperatures, which can make it difficult to get the compound to crystallize out during the cooling process134.\nThe search results explain that the solvent used for recrystallization should have \"mediocre\" dissolving power - good enough to dissolve the compound when hot, but weak enough that the compound will crystallize out when the solution is cooled3. Compounds with very low melting points may remain too soluble even in the cold solvent, preventing effective crystallization14.\nAdditionally, the search results mention that compounds with more rigid molecular structures, which tend to have higher melting points, generally crystallize more easily than more flexible compounds1. So a higher melting point is generally preferred for successful recrystallization.\nIn summary, a low melting point is not ideal for recrystallization, as it indicates the compound will likely remain too soluble in the cold solvent, preventing effective crystallization and purification134.",

Recent studies have found that pyroptosis exacerbates the growth and development of DCM.3 Hyperglycemia, a hallmark of diabetes, can trigger pyroptosis in various cell types involved in DCM, including cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and inflammatory cells.34\nThe molecular mechanisms underlying pyroptosis in DCM involve the NLRP3 inflammasome, which activates inflammatory caspases like caspase-1 that cleave the protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) to induce pyroptosis.24 This leads to the release of inflammatory mediators that further exacerbate cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis.23\nPyroptosis has been observed in different cell types in the diabetic heart, including cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and inflammatory cells. The pyroptosis of these cells promotes the development of DCM through mechanisms like impaired cardiac contractility, endothelial dysfunction, and excessive inflammation.34\nTargeting the NLRP3 inflammasome and downstream pyroptosis pathways has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for DCM. Several drugs and natural compounds have shown promise in inhibiting pyroptosis and improving cardiac function in animal models of DCM.15\nIn summary, pyroptosis is a key driver of DCM pathogenesis, and modulating pyroptosis-related pathways represents an important area of research for developing novel treatments for this diabetic complication.34",
