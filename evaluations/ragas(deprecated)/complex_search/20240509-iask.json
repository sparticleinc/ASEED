The Gibbs free energy change (∆G) for a reaction at constant temperature and pressure is related to the equilibrium constant (K) through the equation:\n   \n\n\n     ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln K\n    \n\n\n    Where:\n   \n\n\n     ΔG is the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction.\n    \n\n     ΔG° is the standard Gibbs free energy change at standard conditions.\n    \n\n     R is the ideal gas constant.\n    \n\n     T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n    \n\n     K is the equilibrium constant for the reaction.\n    \n\n\n    The relationship indicates that when ΔG is negative, the forward reaction is spontaneous, and as ΔG approaches zero, the system reaches equilibrium. If ΔG is positive, the reverse reaction becomes spontaneous. The equilibrium constant K relates to how far a reaction proceeds towards products or reactants at equilibrium.\n   \n\n    In summary:\n   \n\n\n\n      ΔG < 0:\n     \n     Forward reaction is spontaneous.\n    \n\n\n      ΔG = 0:\n     \n     System is at equilibrium.\n    \n\n\n      ΔG > 0:\n     \n     Reverse reaction is spontaneous.\n    \n\n\n    Therefore, by understanding the sign of ΔG in relation to K, one can predict whether a reaction will favor products or reactants at equilibrium based on changes in Gibbs free energy.\n   \n\n\n    These sources were consulted to ensure accuracy and reliability in explaining the relationship between Gibbs free energy and equilibrium constants in chemistry.",

During the period of the Red Army’s Long March, this area served as a strategic location with military significance. The region was part of the wartime rear area in Sichuan, which played a crucial role in providing supplies and support for the war efforts against Japanese aggression. As a result, numerous military bases were established in the vicinity, including within the Dagu River Jin Kou Grand Canyon itself, forming a defensive line during the resistance against Japanese invasion.\n   \n\n    Despite the transition to peacetime, these military remnants are still considered sensitive areas due to their historical importance and potential security implications. The presence of former military installations and structures within the canyon underscores its strategic value during wartime. Therefore, access to certain parts of the Dagu River Jin Kou Grand Canyon is restricted to outsiders, including foreign visitors, as a measure to safeguard national security interests and preserve historical heritage.\n   \n\n    The prohibition on entry without permission from local military authorities serves to maintain confidentiality regarding any remaining classified information or artifacts related to past military activities in the area. By controlling access to these sites, authorities can ensure that sensitive materials are protected and that visitors do not inadvertently disturb or compromise any historical relics or structures present within the canyon.\n   \n\n    In summary, obtaining approval from local military leaders before visiting specific sections of the Dagu River Jin Kou Grand Canyon such as Yixian Heaven’s Gate is essential due to its historical significance as a former military site and its continued relevance for national security considerations.\n   \n\n    These sources were consulted to gather information on Chinese history, cultural heritage protection policies, and national security considerations related to restricted access areas like the Dagu River Jin Kou Grand Canyon.",
