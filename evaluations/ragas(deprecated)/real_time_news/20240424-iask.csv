     Key Points:
    



     The Core CPI has shown three consecutive months of above-forecast increases, indicating a potential slowdown in the previously observed inflation deceleration trend.
    

     Components such as food, energy, and services contributed to the overall inflationary pressures.
    

     The Federal Reserve’s focus on the “Super Core” index, excluding housing costs from core services prices, has shown an acceleration in inflation rates.

     Implications and Analysis:
    
    The higher-than-expected CPI figures have led to a shift in market sentiment regarding early rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The Fed’s cautious approach towards rate cuts is supported by the persistent inflationary pressures indicated by recent data.

    recently experienced a volcanic eruption in Indonesia.
   

    The volcanic eruption occurred on Mount Ruang, which is located on Tagulandang Island, one of the Sangihe Islands off the northern coast of Sulawesi, Indonesia. The eruption began with at least five explosive events since Tuesday, leading to lava flows and ash plumes reaching high into the sky. The Volcanological Survey of Indonesia reported the series of eruptions and raised concerns about a potential tsunami due to fears of a partial collapse of the volcano into the sea.
   

    Indonesian authorities quickly responded by evacuating thousands of residents from the area surrounding Mount Ruang to ensure their safety. The Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation raised the alert status to the highest level due to increased visual activity and seismicity observed at the volcano.
   

    Mount Ruang is classified as a stratovolcano, known for its steep sides and explosive eruptions caused by gas build-up in viscous magma. The recent eruptions were triggered by seismic activity in the region, leading to significant ash emissions and lava flows. Despite the dramatic nature of the eruptions, no casualties have been reported so far.
   

    Indonesia, situated along the Pacific Ring of Fire, is prone to volcanic activity and earthquakes due to its location atop multiple tectonic plates. With over 120 active volcanoes in the country, monitoring and responding to volcanic events are crucial for ensuring public safety.

     Iran utilized a variety of weapons in its attack on Israel, including:
    





       Drones:
      
      Iran launched 170 drones at Israel, primarily using domestically built Shahed 131 and 136 drones. These drones were part of the assault aimed at saturating Israeli and U.S. air defenses.
     




       Ballistic Missiles:
      
      Iran fired Kheibar Shekan and Emad ballistic missiles during the attack. The Kheibar Shekan missiles, unveiled in 2022, are considered among Iran’s most modern ballistic missiles. The Emad missiles have a payload capacity of 1,600 pounds.
     




       Cruise Missiles:
      
      The cruise missiles used in the attack were identified as Paveh missiles by Iran. These missiles were designed to target locations from various directions by taking diverse paths.
     




     Impact of the Attack:
    





       Interception Rate:

      Despite the interception success, a 7-year-old girl from a Bedouin village in Israel’s Negev desert was severely injured by shrapnel during the attack and remained in critical condition.
     




       Successful Hits:
      
      Out of 120 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, only five managed to evade Israeli and U.S. air defenses and hit Israeli territory. Four of these struck the Nevatim Air Base where Israeli F-35s are stationed.

    The GTA 6 publisher, Take-Two Interactive, is laying off approximately 600 employees as part of a broader cost-cutting strategy aimed at enhancing the company’s margin profile while still investing for growth. This decision is also tied to the cancellation of several projects under development, as indicated in the public filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The layoffs are expected to save Take-Two about $165 million annually.
   


     Cost Reduction Program:
    
    Take-Two Interactive is implementing these layoffs and project cancellations to rationalize its pipeline, streamline its organizational structure, and reduce future hiring needs. The company aims to optimize expenses beyond headcount reduction, such as marketing and third-party expenses, to improve efficiency in operations.

    While the layoffs at Take-Two Interactive may raise concerns about the impact on the highly anticipated GTA 6 game, it is important to note that these workforce reductions do not necessarily mean that GTA 6 has been canceled. GTA 6 remains a significant revenue-generating project for the company and is still scheduled for release in 2025.
