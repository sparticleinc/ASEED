     Background of the Incident:
    


    The event in Xishanli, Shilin District, involved a large number of residents experiencing symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea, with over a hundred people affected. The area is a highland community where residents rely on a self-supplied water source system that draws untreated spring water, not the municipal tap water provided by the Taipei Water Department.
   


     Water Quality Issue:
    


    The Taipei Water Department reported that the long-standing problem with high levels of coliform bacteria in the water source system had persisted for some time. The recent contamination may have been exacerbated by seismic activity following an earthquake, leading to increased bacterial and viral content in the underground water leaking into the water source.
   


     Response and Actions Taken:
    


    In response to the situation, emergency measures were implemented by setting up four emergency water collection points to provide safe water sources for residents. Additionally, medical services were offered by Taipei City Hospital to address the health concerns of those affected.
   


     Medical Concerns and Community Response:
    


    Medical professionals raised concerns about potential health risks associated with consuming contaminated water, emphasizing the importance of proper disinfection methods and caution when dealing with such situations.
