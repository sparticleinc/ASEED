However, it is known that the operators issued a mayday call moments before the crash stating that the vessel had lost power. Despite this, the 985-foot-long ship struck one of the bridge’s supports at 8 knots (roughly 9 mph), causing it to snap and fall into the water within seconds. The impact killed six construction workers who were filling potholes on the bridge at the time. The U.S. Coast Guard reported that the ship underwent routine engine maintenance in the port before it lost power. An inspection last June in Chile identified a problem with its “propulsion and auxiliary machinery,” but a standard examination in New York in September did not reveal any deficiencies. The massive weight and force of the ship caused significant damage to the bridge pier, which could not absorb the energy brought by such a large vessel.

The eruption began with at least five explosive events since Tuesday, leading to lava flows and ash plumes reaching high into the sky. The Volcanological Survey of Indonesia reported the series of eruptions and raised concerns about a potential tsunami due to fears of a partial collapse of the volcano into the sea.\n   \n\n    Indonesian authorities quickly responded by evacuating thousands of residents from the area surrounding Mount Ruang to ensure their safety. The Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation raised the alert status to the highest level due to increased visual activity and seismicity observed at the volcano.\n   \n\n    Mount Ruang is classified as a stratovolcano, known for its steep sides and explosive eruptions caused by gas build-up in viscous magma. The recent eruptions were triggered by seismic activity in the region, leading to significant ash emissions and lava flows. Despite the dramatic nature of the eruptions, no casualties have been reported so far.\n   \n\n    Indonesia, situated along the Pacific Ring of Fire, is prone to volcanic activity and earthquakes due to its location atop multiple tectonic plates. With over 120 active volcanoes in the country, monitoring and responding to volcanic events are crucial for ensuring public safety.\n   \n\n    In summary, Mount Ruang on Tagulandang Island recently experienced a volcanic eruption in Indonesia, prompting evacuations and raising concerns about a potential tsunami due to fears of a partial collapse into the sea.",

The employees were protesting Google’s involvement in Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion Israeli government cloud contract. Some of the protesters occupied the office of Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian until they were forcibly removed by law enforcement. In a memo to all employees, Chris Rackow, Google’s head of global security, stated that the behavior was unacceptable and violated multiple company policies. He warned that more action would be taken if needed. The “No Tech for Apartheid” group behind the protests called Google’s firings a “flagrant act of retaliation.” The group had been organizing against Project Nimbus for three years and demanded that Google pull out of the contract due to concerns about the technology being weaponized against Palestinians in Gaza. The fired employees were among those who directly participated in the disruptive activity inside Google buildings.

            "question": "What weapons were used to attack Israel from Iran?",
            "answer": "Weapons Used in the Attack on Israel from Iran:\n    \n\n\n\n     Iran utilized a variety of weapons in its attack on Israel, including:\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       Drones:\n      \n      Iran launched 170 drones at Israel, primarily using domestically built Shahed 131 and 136 drones. These drones were part of the assault aimed at saturating Israeli and U.S. air defenses.\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Ballistic Missiles:\n      \n      Iran fired Kheibar Shekan and Emad ballistic missiles during the attack. The Kheibar Shekan missiles, unveiled in 2022, are considered among Iran’s most modern ballistic missiles. The Emad missiles have a payload capacity of 1,600 pounds.\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Cruise Missiles:\n      \n      The cruise missiles used in the attack were identified as Paveh missiles by Iran. These missiles were designed to target locations from various directions by taking diverse paths.\n     \n\n\n\n\n     Impact of the Attack:\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       Interception Rate:\n      \n      The Israel Defense Forces reported that virtually all incoming threats were intercepted before reaching Israeli territory, resulting in minimal damage.\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Casualties:\n      \n      Despite the interception success, a 7-year-old girl from a Bedouin village in Israel’s Negev desert was severely injured by shrapnel during the attack and remained in critical condition.\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Successful Hits:\n      \n      Out of 120 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, only five managed to evade Israeli and U.S. air defenses and hit Israeli territory. Four of these struck the Nevatim Air Base where Israeli F-35s are stationed.\n     \n\n\n\n\n     Response and Aftermath:\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       Foreign Minister’s Response:\n      \n      Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian downplayed the attack as a warning and stated that it was not intended to cause significant damage to civilians but rather had a military purpose.\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Retaliation:\n      \n      Following the Iranian attack on Israel, tensions escalated with Israel conducting a retaliatory strike on an Iranian military airfield near Isfahan. This strike did not result in significant damage or casualties.\n     \n\n\n\n    In summary, Iran employed drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles in its unprecedented attack on Israel. While most of these weapons were intercepted before reaching their targets, some managed to hit Israeli territory, resulting in limited damage.",

            "question": "Why is GTA 6 publisher laying off 600 employees",
            "answer": "Reasons for Layoffs:\n    \n    The GTA 6 publisher, Take-Two Interactive, is laying off approximately 600 employees as part of a broader cost-cutting strategy aimed at enhancing the company’s margin profile while still investing for growth. This decision is also tied to the cancellation of several projects under development, as indicated in the public filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The layoffs are expected to save Take-Two about $165 million annually.\n   \n\n\n     Cost Reduction Program:\n    \n    Take-Two Interactive is implementing these layoffs and project cancellations to rationalize its pipeline, streamline its organizational structure, and reduce future hiring needs. The company aims to optimize expenses beyond headcount reduction, such as marketing and third-party expenses, to improve efficiency in operations.\n   \n\n\n     Impact on GTA 6:\n    \n    While the layoffs at Take-Two Interactive may raise concerns about the impact on the highly anticipated GTA 6 game, it is important to note that these workforce reductions do not necessarily mean that GTA 6 has been canceled. GTA 6 remains a significant revenue-generating project for the company and is still scheduled for release in 2025.\n   \n\n\n    These sources collectively contributed to understanding why Take-Two Interactive, as the publisher of GTA 6, decided to lay off employees despite previous statements indicating no immediate plans for such actions.",
            "ground_truths": [
                "The decision to lay off approximately 600 employees at Take-Two Interactive, the parent company of Rockstar Games, is part of a broader cost-cutting strategy. The company is rationalizing its pipeline, eliminating several projects in development, and streamlining its organizational structure. This downsizing process is expected to be largely complete by the end of the year 2024. Additionally, Take-Two had already signaled its intention for a significant cost reduction plan following mixed financial results for the quarter ending in December 2023. Despite these challenges, Take-Two has continued to invest in its portfolio, including the acquisition of Gearbox and the development of the highly anticipated 'GTA 6'."
