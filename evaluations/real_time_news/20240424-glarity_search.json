            "answer": "The collision of the ship with the Baltimore bridge was caused by the vessel, named Dali, losing power abruptly. The incident occurred around 1:30 am local time when the ship struck a support column on the Key Bridge, leading to the collapse of the bridge structure. Prior to the collision, the Dali had departed the Port of Baltimore around 1:00 am with a cargo bound for Sri Lanka. The exact reason for the power loss that resulted in the collision is still under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. However, details from an inspection of the ship in Chile last June had identified issues with its propulsion and auxiliary machinery, specifically related to gauges and thermometers.\n\nThe impact of the ship hitting the bridge support was significant due to the vessel's massive weight and velocity. Moving at 8 knots, roughly equivalent to 9 mph, the ship struck the bridge with substantial force. As explained by an engineering professor, the force of the collision overwhelmed the bridge support, causing the span to break and fall into the water within moments. Despite federal inspectors rating the 47-year-old bridge in fair condition the previous June, it lacked adequate pier protection to withstand such a collision. \n\nIn essence, the ship's sudden loss of power while passing under the Key Bridge led to the collision that resulted in the catastrophic collapse of a portion of the bridge. Investigations are ongoing to determine the exact factors contributing to the power failure and the subsequent collision between the Dali and the bridge support.",

            "answer": "Google decided to terminate 28 employees due to protests held inside its work offices. These protests were in response to Google's involvement in a $1.2 billion cloud computing contract with the Israeli government. The employees who were fired were part of sit-in protests that took place at Google offices in New York and Sunnyvale, California. These protests were organized to oppose Google's collaboration in Project Nimbus, which also involved Amazon. Some employees even occupied the office of Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian until law enforcement intervened and removed them. The protests were part of the No Tech for Apartheid campaign, emphasizing concerns about the tech giant's support for the Israeli government amidst conflicts with Hamas in Gaza.\n\nGoogle deemed the actions of these employees as a violation of company policies, specifically the code of conduct and harassment rules. According to Google's vice president of global security, Chris Rackow, the terminated employees disrupted the workplace by taking over office spaces, defacing property, and obstructing the work of other employees. This disruption was considered unacceptable, extremely disruptive, and created a sense of threat among co-workers, as per a memo obtained by the New York Post.\n\nIn light of the situation, Google emphasized that such behavior had no place within the company and would not be tolerated. This decision to terminate employees sends a clear message to the workforce that actions infringing upon company policies and disrupting the workplace will face serious consequences. In summary, Google's move to fire 28 employees following the protests inside work offices underscores the company's commitment to upholding its workplace standards and maintaining a conducive work environment free of such disruptions.",

            "question": "What weapons were used to attack Israel from Iran?",
            "answer": "The recent attack on Israel from Iran involved a variety of weapons. Iranian state news agency, IRNA, reported that the attack included the use of Shahed 131 and 136 drones, Kheibar Shekan and Emad ballistic missiles, as well as Paveh cruise missiles. The Shahed drones, with a range of around 1,200 miles, and the ballistic missiles, particularly the modern Kheibar Shekan and Emad missiles capable of carrying a payload of 1,600 pounds, were part of the arsenal used in the attack. Additionally, the Paveh cruise missiles, known for their ability to target from multiple directions, were also deployed in the attack. Despite these weapons, the IDF reported that none of the drones or missiles from Iran crossed into Israeli territory, with most being intercepted or failing to launch successfully.\n\nThe attack from Iran involved a significant number of weapons, but Israel's defense systems, particularly the Iron Dome and Arrow 3, played a crucial role in intercepting and neutralizing the majority of the incoming threats. The Iron Dome defense system is designed to intercept rockets that fly in high arcs, while the Arrow 3 system is effective against ballistic missiles outside the atmosphere. These defensive weapons, alongside support from U.S. forces and other allies, successfully thwarted the attack, with only a few missiles managing to breach Israeli and U.S. air defenses and hit Israeli territory. This incident highlights the importance of robust defense mechanisms in countering such threats effectively.",

                "Iran fired 170 drones, more than 30 cruise missiles and more than 120 ballistic missiles. Of those, several ballistic missiles reached Israeli territory, causing minor damage to an air base."

            "question": "Why is GTA 6 publisher laying off 600 employees",
            "answer": "The GTA 6 publisher, Take-Two Interactive, is laying off approximately 600 employees as part of a cost-cutting strategy. This decision to downsize the workforce is part of a broader initiative to reduce costs and streamline the organization. Despite having a significant increase in net revenue last year, the company is aiming to enhance its financial position by eliminating several projects under development and rationalizing its pipeline .\n\nThis move by Take-Two Interactive comes as a surprise to many, especially after the company had previously stated that there were no current plans for layoffs. The layoffs are expected to save an estimated $140 million and impact around 600 of the company's 11,000 employees . By canceling projects and trimming down its workforce, Take-Two Interactive is likely aiming to optimize its operations and focus on key projects that can drive future growth and profitability.\n\nIn the gaming industry, such large-scale layoffs are not uncommon, and they often reflect the evolving priorities and strategies of companies in response to changing market conditions. While the exact reasons behind the decision to lay off employees may not be fully disclosed, it is clear that Take-Two Interactive is making these tough choices to position itself better in the competitive gaming market and ensure financial stability in the long term .",
