            "answer": "GTA 6 publisher Take-Two Interactive is laying off around 5% of its workforce, which amounts to approximately 579 employees.13 The layoffs are part of a cost-cutting measure and restructuring effort, as the company is also canceling several unannounced projects that were in development.4\nWhile the exact reasons behind the layoffs are not explicitly stated, it is likely a move to reduce costs and focus resources on the company's most promising and profitable projects. The video game industry has seen numerous layoffs and hiring freezes in recent months, with companies like Electronic Arts, Amazon, and others also cutting jobs.24\nThe layoffs at Take-Two come as the company is in the final stages of developing the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA 6).1 However, it is unclear if the layoffs will directly impact the development of GTA 6 or if the game was one of the projects spared from cancellation.",
            "ground_truths": [
                "The decision to lay off approximately 600 employees at Take-Two Interactive, the parent company of Rockstar Games, is part of a broader cost-cutting strategy. The company is rationalizing its pipeline, eliminating several projects in development, and streamlining its organizational structure. This downsizing process is expected to be largely complete by the end of the year 2024. Additionally, Take-Two had already signaled its intention for a significant cost reduction plan following mixed financial results for the quarter ending in December 2023. Despite these challenges, Take-Two has continued to invest in its portfolio, including the acquisition of Gearbox and the development of the highly anticipated 'GTA 6'."
