{},What precisely caused the ship to collide with the Baltimore bridge?,"The ship, named Dali, collided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore because it lost propulsion and power moments before the crash. Specifically:


The crew of the Dali issued a mayday call reporting they had lost power just before striking the bridge at a very rapid speed of around 8 knots (9 mph).24


Video footage showed the Dali's lights flickering off shortly before impact, indicating a loss of power.1


An inspection of the Dali in Chile last June had identified issues with the ship's propulsion and auxiliary systems, including problems with gauges and thermometers.2


Authorities stated that the loss of propulsion left the massive ship essentially a ""dead ship"" being carried by its own momentum, making it unable to stop or change course before crashing into the bridge support.4


So the direct cause appears to be a catastrophic power/propulsion failure on the Dali cargo ship as it was departing Baltimore, leaving it unable to maneuver or slow down before slamming into the bridge structure.124","['When the container ship MV Dali, 300 metres long and massing around 100,000 tonnes, lost power and slammed into one of the support piers of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, the bridge collapsed in moments.']",['lost power'],True
