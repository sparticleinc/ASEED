    In 2013, the messaging app Telegram was founded by Pavel and Nikolai Durov, and it has been owned by them ever since. While the first legal entity of Telegram was opened in Russia in the same year, due to Pavel Durov’s negative experience with business confiscation practices, he registered three managing entities of Telegram in the UK. Additionally, Telegram has multiple offices in Dubai. The main operational center of Telegram is located in Dubai, UAE, and its servers are distributed worldwide, including in the USA.
   

    Despite being associated with Russia due to its founders’ background and initial legal entity registration, Pavel Durov has emphasized that Telegram is not a Russian product. He highlighted that there are no servers, developers, legal entities, bank accounts, or offices of Telegram in Russia. Furthermore, there have been reports indicating that part of the Telegram team worked in St. Petersburg but without an official office presence.
   

    Telegram Messenger LLP received a notice of liquidation in the UK in 2019 as Pavel Durov initiated the process to dissolve the company. This action further solidifies the fact that Telegram’s operations are not tied to Russia.

{},What will Trump do to China if he takes office again?,"Trump’s Potential Actions Towards China if Re-elected:
    


    If Donald Trump were to take office again, his approach towards China is likely to be characterized by a continuation and potentially escalation of his previous policies. During his first term, Trump implemented a series of aggressive measures aimed at addressing what he perceived as unfair trade practices and economic competition from China. Some key actions he might take if re-elected include:
   




       Increased Tariffs and Trade Measures:
      
      Trump could further raise tariffs on Chinese imports as a means of pressuring Beijing to make concessions in trade negotiations. He has shown a willingness to use tariffs as a tool to address what he views as trade imbalances and unfair practices by China.
     




       Tech Controls and Decoupling:
      
      There is a possibility that Trump would intensify restrictions on Chinese technology companies and pursue policies that could lead to a partial or full decoupling of the U.S. and Chinese economies in critical sectors such as technology and telecommunications.
     




       Geopolitical Shifts:
      
      A second term for Trump could see a continuation of his “America First” stance, potentially leading to shifts in alliances that could impact the geopolitical balance in favor of China. This may involve changes in how the U.S. engages with its allies on issues related to China’s influence and global ambitions.
     




       Taiwan Policy:
      
      Trump’s administration had taken steps to strengthen ties with Taiwan, including arms sales and high-level visits, which angered Beijing. If re-elected, he might continue to challenge China’s stance on Taiwan, potentially escalating tensions in the region.
     




       Economic Pressure:
      
      Trump could maintain or increase economic pressure on China through various means, such as sanctions, export controls, or financial measures, with the aim of addressing issues related to intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, and market access.
     



    In summary, if Donald Trump were to be re-elected as President of the United States, his approach towards China is likely to involve a combination of economic pressure tactics, technological restrictions, potential decoupling efforts, geopolitical realignments, and continued focus on challenging China on key strategic issues.","[""If Trump takes office again, his stance on China is expected to remain tough and potentially escalate. During his previous term, Trump initiated a trade war with China by imposing significant tariffs on Chinese imports. He has indicated that if reelected, he plans to intensify this trade war by imposing tariffs as high as 60% or more on Chinese imports\nThis move is part of his strategy to address what he perceives as unfair trade practices by China and to protect American industries and jobs from what he views as Chinese economic threats\nFurthermore, Trump's combative approach towards China extends beyond trade policies. He has expressed intentions to phase out Chinese imports of essential goods over a four-year period, including electronics, steel, and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, Trump aims to ban Chinese companies from owning critical U.S. infrastructure in sectors such as energy, technology, and agriculture, highlighting national security concerns underpinning his China policy\nOverall, Trump's stance towards China is expected to prioritize protecting American economic interests and maintaining a competitive edge in key industries.

{},Why is Boeing getting worse and worse?,"Based on the most recent information available as of 2024-04-24, Boeing’s troubles continue to mount with a string of incidents and crises. The company has faced numerous issues with its aircraft, including flight controls jamming, de-icing equipment concerns, and a sudden mid-air plunge on a LATAM flight that injured dozens of passengers. These incidents have led to investigations by regulatory agencies and lawsuits, potentially resulting in billions of dollars in losses for Boeing.
   

    Beyond these specific incidents, Boeing’s financial situation is also a concern. The company’s reliance on the Defense division to offset losses in civil aviation may no longer be sustainable due to constraints on government spending. Additionally, Boeing’s leadership and culture have been criticized for prioritizing financial gains over engineering excellence.
   

    The recent crises have not come out of the blue and should not have surprised Boeing’s management, given the company’s history of safety issues and the fact that several executives have been involved with the company for years. The lack of engineering expertise at the top levels of Boeing has been identified as a significant problem, with engineers being squeezed out of the company culture.

     1. Trade Relations:
    
    Germany is one of China’s most important trading partners within the EU. The decoupling would disrupt existing trade relations, affecting German exports to China and imports from China. German industries that heavily rely on exports to China, such as automotive, machinery, and electronics, would face challenges in finding alternative markets or adjusting their production.
   


     2. Supply Chains:
    
    Many German companies have integrated Chinese suppliers into their global supply chains. A decoupling could lead to disruptions in the supply chain, increased costs due to restructuring, and potential delays in production. This could impact various sectors of the German economy and reduce competitiveness.
   


     3. Investment Flows:
    
    China has been a significant source of investment for Germany, particularly in technology and manufacturing sectors. If decoupling occurs, Chinese investments in Germany may decrease, affecting innovation, job creation, and economic growth in specific regions.
   


     4. Economic Growth:
    
    The overall economic growth of Germany could be negatively impacted by the decoupling from China. The uncertainty and instability resulting from such a significant shift in economic relations could lead to reduced investor confidence, lower consumer spending, and a slowdown in GDP growth.
   


     5. Diplomatic Relations:
    
    Decoupling from China could strain diplomatic relations between Germany and other EU countries that have varying perspectives on their approach towards China. It may also affect broader geopolitical dynamics within the EU and globally.
   


     Conclusion:
    
    In conclusion, if the EU decides to “decouple” from China, it would likely have adverse effects on Germany’s economy across various sectors including trade, supply chains, investment flows, economic growth, and diplomatic relations.
