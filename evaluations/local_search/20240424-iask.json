            "question": "四面楚歌的主人公是谁？",
            "answer": "The main answer to the question “Who is the main character in the idiom ‘四面楚歌’?” is Project Fei (Project Yu in English names), also known as Zhuge Liang or Zhuge Dan, who was a famous military strategist and politician during the Shu Han period of China’s Three Kingdoms era. The idiom ‘四面楚歌’ refers to a situation where someone is surrounded and besieged by enemies from all sides, leaving them isolated and without support. The story behind this idiom comes from an incident during the Battle of Red Cliffs, where Project Fei, who had previously made a treaty with Liu Bang (Emperor Guangwu of Han), was besieged by Liu Bang’s forces along with other allied lords. Feeling despair and believing that he had lost the support of his people and that the heavens were against him, Fei drank and sang sad songs with his favorite concubine, Lady Diao Chan, until they both wept. Eventually, he led his remaining soldiers to escape towards the south but was eventually defeated and committed suicide by the river. The use of ‘四面楚歌’ as an idiom today refers to a situation where someone is surrounded and under attack from all sides, leaving them feeling helpless and isolated.\n   \n\n    Here are some additional details about Project Fei and the Battle of Red Cliffs:\n   \n\n\n     Project Fei was born in 181 AD in present-day Hubei Province, China. He was a brilliant military strategist and politician who served as the prime minister of Shu Han during its existence from 221 to 263 AD.\n    \n\n     In 208 AD, during the Battle of Red Cliffs, Project Fei led an alliance of southern warlords against Cao Cao’s northern forces. Despite being outnumbered, Project Fei used his strategic genius to construct a massive pontoon bridge across the Yangtze River to allow his troops to cross over and surprise Cao Cao’s forces. This battle is famous for its large-scale naval engagement and is depicted in many works of Chinese literature and art.\n    \n\n     After the Battle of Red Cliffs, Project Fei continued to serve as prime minister of Shu Han until his death in 234 AD. He is remembered for his wisdom, military prowess, and literary achievements.\n    \n\n     The exact location of the Battle of Red Cliffs is not definitively known, but it is believed to have taken place near present-day Ezhou City in Hubei Province. There are several tourist sites related to the battle, including the Red Cliffs Scenic Area and the Museum of the Battle of Red Cliffs.\n    \n\n     The idiom ‘四面楚歌’ has been used in Chinese literature and language for over a thousand years and continues to be widely used today to describe situations where someone is surrounded or under attack from all sides. It has also been translated into English as ‘encircled by enemies’, ‘besieged on all sides’, or ‘surrounded by adversity’.",

            "answer": "In a business or formal dining setting, when dining with leaders or clients, the rotating table should turn clockwise.\n    \n\n\n    In Chinese culture and etiquette, it is customary for the rotating table in a business or formal dining setting to turn clockwise. This tradition is rooted in showing respect and courtesy to the guests, especially leaders or elders present at the meal. The practice of turning the table clockwise is believed to bring smoothness and harmony to the dining experience.\n   \n\n    When a new dish is served, the rotating table should be turned so that it reaches the host, honored guests, or seniors first. This gesture allows them to have the first opportunity to sample the dish before it is passed on to others at the table. By following this protocol of turning the table clockwise, diners demonstrate their consideration for hierarchy and seniority during the meal.\n   \n\n    However, there are exceptions to this rule where the table may be rotated counterclockwise. In sporting events like races or competitions such as running or speed skating, movement direction dictates counterclockwise rotation. Additionally, during farewell ceremonies or memorial services, counterclockwise rotation symbolizes retracing the path of a departed individual as a way of honoring their legacy and contributions.\n   \n\n    Therefore, in most cases during business or formal dining occasions in Chinese culture,\n    \n     the appropriate direction for rotating the table is clockwise as a sign of respect and adherence to traditional customs\n    \n    .",

However, this statement can sometimes be misleading as it may not guarantee genuine kindness or tenderness. The phrase “会疼人” should be taken with caution as it might not accurately reflect the person’s true nature or behavior in a relationship.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n     China Daily:\n    \n    China Daily is a reputable English-language newspaper in China known for its coverage of various cultural aspects, including traditional practices like matchmaking and the role of matchmakers in Chinese society.\n   \n\n\n     The New York Times:\n    \n    As a globally recognized newspaper, The New York Times often covers cultural practices from around the world, providing insights into different customs and traditions, which can include discussions on matchmaking and relationship dynamics.\n   \n\n\n     BBC News:\n    \n    BBC News is a reliable source for international news and cultural reporting.
