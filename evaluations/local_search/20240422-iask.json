This association stemmed from the poetic comparisons made by ancient poets, who often likened chrysanthemums to yellow flowers. The chrysanthemum was highly regarded for its ability to withstand frost and cold weather, symbolizing integrity and moral character. Therefore, when used to describe young unmarried women, the term “黄花” implied purity, integrity, and noble character similar to that of the chrysanthemum.\n   \n\n    The chrysanthemum’s symbolism of purity and resilience in the face of adversity made it a fitting representation for young maidens who were expected to uphold their virtue and moral standards before marriage. The color yellow, associated with joy and positivity, further enhanced the connotations of youthfulness and innocence attributed to unmarried women.\n   \n\n    In essence, the use of\n    \n     菊花\n    \n    as the reference for “黄花” in describing young maidens reflected the cultural values placed on chastity, integrity, and moral uprightness in ancient Chinese society.",
