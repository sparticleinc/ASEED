# ASEED

ASEED (AI Search Engine Evaluation Dataset) is a dataset rewritten based on real user search scenarios, which is used to evaluate the question-answering quality of current mainstream AI search engines.

## Intruduction

We plan to create a standardized and comprehensive dataset to evaluate AI search engines comprehensively and accurately. Considering the language diversity of the global user community, our evaluation report covers multiple languages including English, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Russian, and Traditional Chinese, and has conducted preliminary testing and evaluation on the accuracy of these question-answering search engine products.

## Evaluation Method and Results

**Testing Method**
  - **Accuracy**：Manual Evaluation

    The actual answers are manually compared with the Ground truth and Key words. If the answer is a match or relevant, it is marked as "True"; otherwise, it is "False".
  
  - **Answer Correctness**: GPT-4 Scoring

    The Answer correctness metric from the Ragas platform, with the GPT-4-Turbo model being used for evaluation. The formula for calculating “Answer correctness” is as follows.

**Evaluation Metrics**
| Metric     | Definition of Evaluation | Advantages |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Accuracy       | Manual evaluation of the actual answers based on Ground truth and key words     | Precise assessment|
| Answer correctness        | GPT-4 comparison of Ground truth with actual answers     | Less labor-intensive|

**Product Selection**

To conduct this performance evaluation of question-answering search engines, we referred to the list of leading AI search engine products provided by the [aicpb.com](https://dnipkggqxh.feishu.cn/wiki/YTIUwM6Vmij4IQkSm9PctPWunIb) website. After excluding traditional keyword search engines, we carefully selected four of the most outstanding AI question-answering search engine products on the market for our evaluation.

The specific information about the aforementioned four products is as follows (referenced from statistics at [aicpb.com](https://dnipkggqxh.feishu.cn/wiki/YTIUwM6Vmij4IQkSm9PctPWunIb)):

| Rank | Product Name | Category | Monthly Visits (March) | MoM Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Perplexity | AI Search Engine | 64.14M | 25.17% |
| 3 | You.com | AI Search Engine | 10.44M | 14.61% |
| 5 | Metaso | AI Search Engine | 7.21M | 551.36% |
| 7 | iAsk | AI Search Engine | 3.43M | 15.43% |

**Detailed test results**

- Overall, the performance of the evaluated products did not meet our expectations. However, it is noteworthy that Metaso, a company primarily serving the Chinese market, performed the best overall in the evaluation, slightly surpassing Perplexity.

<br>
<br>

- The comprehensive data analysis of all products indicates that the highest accuracy is achieved in answering questions in English. By contrast, Russian questions have the lowest accuracy rate, and the accuracy for Japanese questions is also relatively low.

<br>
<br>

- In terms of performance by language, Perplexity leads by a significant margin in answering English questions, and its performance in Simplified Chinese is also quite impressive. Metaso stands out in its performance in both Simplified and Traditional Chinese. However, both companies did not reach a satisfactory level in other languages. iAsk demonstrated relatively balanced capabilities across different languages, but overall, it falls within the medium range. You.com, on the other hand, performed well only in answering questions in English.

## Future plans
In the future, we plan to expand our evaluation test set, adding more languages and query scenarios to provide a more comprehensive and detailed performance assessment. We believe that with technological advancements and the enrichment of datasets, AI question-answering search engines will be able to better meet the diverse needs of global users and play an even more important role in the future of search technology.
