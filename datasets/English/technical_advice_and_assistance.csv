0,what are the applications of lidar in aerospace industry?,"Terrain and Obstacle Mapping: LiDAR can be used to create highly accurate 3D maps of terrain, landscapes, and obstacles. This is useful for mission planning, navigation, and situational awareness in aerospace applications.
Aircraft and Satellite Detection and Tracking: LiDAR can be used to detect and track aircraft, satellites, and space debris with high precision. This aids in airspace management and collision avoidance.
Airport Operations: LiDAR can provide precise measurements of runway conditions, including detecting foreign object debris (FOD) and runway surface damage. This improves airport safety and efficiency.
Autonomous Navigation: LiDAR is a key sensor used in the navigation systems of autonomous aerial vehicles like drones, allowing them to detect and avoid obstacles.
Bathymetric Mapping: Military applications of LiDAR include bathymetric mapping, which can precisely image terrain features both on land and in the water, useful for naval operations",,,
